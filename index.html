  <h2>philosophical monday rant</h2>
<p>everyone says i'm supposed to choose what will make me happy for the rest of my life now, but no matter what choice i make now i probably won't be happy with it in the future. i'm left aimless in a sense, with no path or purpose, and no motivation. good grades don't have any appeal anymore because i don't know what to do with them, other than the supposed college i'll soon be attending. i feel content now, i don't really want to change that. the monotony of everyday life scares me and i fear i'll grow tired of it no matter my career. it's human nature to always strive to achieve, but by the time you've succeeded, you've moved onto something else. true happiness in the sense is impossible to obtain; in reality it only offers temporary relief in a world of advertisements, power, fame, control, a world in which megacorporations make decisions for us whether they're desireable or not. in the eyes of history, the middle-class man is forgotten, as is the honest man. only those who are strongest, loudest, most controversial can build a reputation. more than half of the population will never be remembered once they die, </p>
