  <h2>philosophical monday rant</h2>
<p>everyone says i'm supposed to choose what will make me happy for the rest of my life now, but no matter what choice i make now i probably won't be happy with it in the future. i'm left aimless in a sense, with no path or purpose, and no motivation. good grades don't have any appeal anymore because i don't know what to do with them, other than the supposed college i'll soon be attending. </p>
